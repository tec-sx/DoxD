/** This class provides a randomly generated seed that is specific to the actor / object and lasts for their entire
lifetime. It's intention is for use as a seed for pseudo-random outcomes that have been pre-determined at or close
to the time of the actor's creation. Anything attributable to 'Deus Ex Machina' should be derived from this value.
By doing this, an actor's fate is literally sealed at their birth / creation for events based on this value.

The value can also be used for simple things like innate aptitude for various subjects. It can act as a simple
form of DNA, locking in attributes specific to a character.

Because it's possible to use a memory sniffer to determine this value after creation, it's suggested you either
start with a 0 value "no fate" or a random value that is switched once or more at later stages of a character's
development. */
